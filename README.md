## 🚨 Problem

- A study found **errors in 67% of hand-off sheets**, raising serious concerns about patient safety.  
- Improving hand-off communication has been shown to **reduce adverse events by 47%**, emphasizing the need for better systems.  
- Patient handoffs are often **time-consuming**, **inefficient**, and **mentally exhausting** for healthcare workers — especially in emergency settings.
